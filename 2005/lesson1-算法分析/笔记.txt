1.性能就像经济领域的货币一样，是软件的基础
2.Sort Problem
    Input: sequence of <a1, a2, a3, a4> of numbers
    Output: permutation of numbers

    (1). Insertion Sort 
        insertionSort(A[1...n])
            for j=2 to n：
                do key = A[j]
                while key < A[j--]
                   swap(key A[j--])
                A[j--] = key
        Running Time
          - Depeneds on input(e.g. already sorted)
          - Depend on input sizes(less than 30 items better than mergeSort)
          - Need upper bound(guarantee to user)

        Kinds of analys
          Worst case(usually)
            T(n) = max time on any input size of n
          Average case(somethims)
            T(n) = expected time over all inputs of n
            (need asumption of statics distrbution)
          Best case(bogus)

        What is insertion sort's worst-case time?
          Depends on computer
            - relative speed(on same machine)
            - absolute speend(on diff machine)
          Asymptotic notation
            -look growth of running time
            θ notation (drop lower term ignoreleading constants)
              Ex. 3n^3 + 5n^2 + 68 = θ(n^3)
              as n - inf, θ(n^2)alg always beats θ(n^3) alg
          Worst Case
            -input reverse sorted
            - (j=2→n)∑θ(j) = θ(n^2)

    (2). Merge Sort
        mergeSort(A[1...n])
          1. If n == 1, done
          2. Recursurely sort A[1...(n/2)] and A[(n/2)+1...n] (2T(n/2))
          3. Merge two list (θ(n))

          T(n) = 2T(n/2) + θ(n) = θ(nlgn)
